## Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Hours)

### 1. Cloudflare Setup (30 minutes)

```bash
# Authenticate with Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Create D1 database
wrangler d1 create skillstash-registry
# Save the database_id output

# Create R2 bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create skillstash-cache

# Set GitHub token secret (for indexer)
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN --env production
# Enter your GitHub personal access token
```

### 2. Update Configuration Files (10 minutes)

Update these files with your actual database ID:
- `workers/api/wrangler.toml`
- `workers/indexer/wrangler.toml`

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "skillstash-registry"
database_id = "your-actual-database-id-here"  # ← Update this
```

### 3. Deploy Backend Workers (30 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy API worker
cd workers/api
wrangler deploy

# Test API endpoint
curl https://skillstash-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}

# Deploy Indexer worker
cd ../indexer
wrangler deploy

# Test indexer endpoint
curl https://skillstash-indexer.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

### 4. Initialize Database (15 minutes)

```bash
# Run migrations (local first to test)
pnpm db:generate
pnpm --filter @skillstash/db exec drizzle-kit push:sqlite --config=drizzle.config.ts

# Load seed data
wrangler d1 execute skillstash-registry --file=packages/db/src/seed.sql

# Verify data loaded
wrangler d1 execute skillstash-registry --command="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plugins"
```

### 5. Deploy Frontend (30 minutes)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy web app
cd apps/web
vercel --prod

# Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://skillstash-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL=https://skillstash-indexer.your-subdomain.workers.dev

# Test deployment
curl https://your-app.vercel.app
