## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| D1 database limits | High | Cache heavily in R2, plan for PostgreSQL migration |
| GitHub rate limiting | Medium | Use auth token, implement backoff |
| Slow search | Medium | Pre-index, use Typesense if needed |
| Worker cold starts | Low | Use cron to keep warm |

### Product Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| No plugins to index | High | Manually add initial plugins |
| No user adoption | High | Target existing plugin authors |
| Poor UX | Medium | User testing pre-launch |
| Bugs at launch | Medium | Thorough testing, graceful errors |

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical bugs discovered post-launch:

```bash
# Rollback web
cd apps/web
vercel rollback

# Rollback workers
cd workers/api
wrangler rollback

# Unpublish CLI (last resort)
npm unpublish @skillstash/cli@1.0.0 --force
```
