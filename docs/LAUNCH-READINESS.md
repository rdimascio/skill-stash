# Configure Alchemy with Cloudflare credentials
alchemy configure
# Enter: Cloudflare API Token
# Enter: Cloudflare Account ID

# Authenticate with Cloudflare
alchemy login
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup (5 minutes)

Create `.env` file in project root:

```bash
# Copy example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your values
nano .env
```

Add the following to `.env`:
```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your-cloudflare-account-id

ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### 3. Deploy All Infrastructure with Alchemy (15 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy everything (D1, R2, both Workers)
pnpm deploy:workers

# OR use Alchemy directly
alchemy deploy

# Expected output:
# ✅ D1 Database created: skillstash-registry
# ✅ R2 Bucket created: skillstash-cache
# ✅ API Worker deployed: https://skillstash-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev
# ✅ ingester Worker deployed: https://skillstash-ingester.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

### 4. Verify Deployment (15 minutes)

```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl https://skillstash-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}

# Test ingester endpoint
curl https://skillstash-ingester.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}

# Seed database
wrangler d1 execute skillstash-registry --remote --file=packages/db/src/seed.sql
```

### 5. Deploy Frontend (30 minutes)

```bash
# Deploy web app to Vercel
cd apps/web
vercel --prod

# Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://skillstash-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev
